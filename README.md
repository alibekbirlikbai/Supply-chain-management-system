## Description

This project aims to smoothen the supply chain management process by closely monitoring the dealers 
and clients and continually tracking the products through the different points in the supply chain

Application modules:
* Admin module – The Admin uses this module to check information on the manufactured products, newly launched products, and products that must be delivered to the clients.
* Dealer module – This module keeps track of all the essential information concerning the dealers, particularly the record of items. Dealers can generate and update the item list for a product using this module.
* Client module – The client uses this module to provide the necessary specifications of a product. The client feedback is processed through this module and forwarded to the Admin.
